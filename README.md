## Launch interactive notebooks in Binder
Click below to launch an interactive Jupyter environment (no installation required):

[![Launch on Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ollie-hulme/BayesianModels/main?urlpath=lab)

## Dependencies
The course is designed to run on Binder without you needing to set anything up on your local machine. However if you wish to run the code on your own machine you can follow the instructions. Then you can run the notebooks of this repo in your local Jupyter Lab environment.


Install Miniforge (if not already installed):
https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#miniforge3

Download this repo and change directory into it.
Copy this into your terminal to set up the environment and open jupyter:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate bayesian-models
jupyter lab
```

Now you should be able to open the notebooks that are in the /notebooks folder
