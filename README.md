## I have to leave at X o'clock to do Y
It's generally fine, just be sure to catch up on the activities if you are taking it for credit. All materials are online. Talk to a buddy in your class about what you missed, or ask on the whatsapp channel.  

## Can I prepare?
We will be teaching a lot from this book, Bayesian Cognitive Modeling by Wagenmakers and Lee. There is a free and legal download of part of this book available here. Reading this PDF will help you familiarise yourself with the material, but don't worry too much if it is hard at first. Just getting familiar with it and knowing the bits you don't understand is a really good start. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vCoDyoeqmH6q6h3a1AXmWwTXKDETlS3a/view

## What to bring?
Bring your laptop and a charger (duh).
Make sure you have eduroam working, or if not, a phone with a data plan that gets you internet access on your laptop.

## How am I evaluated?
There is no exam or grading, but there is a group project.
Everyone taking the course for credit via the PhD school will do a group project and a group mini-presentation at the end of the week. 
Those taking it without credit are welcome to do a group project too, but it's optional.

## I am not signed up via the PhD school, can I still claim ECTS?
If you attend the full week and you do the group work, yes. I can write you a certificate and you can try to claim ECTS after the course, however, we cannot guarantee your program will accept this. They usually do, but we cannot promise. 

## Where are the slides?
The course slides will all be in this repo, but just be aware that most of them will not be available until after the lecture. 

## How do I access the interactive exercises?
There are many interactive exercises in this course. 
Click below to launch an interactive Jupyter environment (no installation required):

[![Launch on Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ollie-hulme/BayesianModels/main?urlpath=lab)

## Can I run the interactive exercises locally?
The course is designed to run on Binder without you needing to set anything up on your local machine. However, if you wish to run the code on your machine, you can follow the instructions. Then you can run the notebooks of this repo in your local Jupyter Lab environment.

Install Miniforge (if not already installed):
https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#miniforge3

Download this repo and change directory into it.
Copy this into your terminal to set up the environment and open Jupyter:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate bayesian-models
jupyter lab
```

Now you should be able to open the notebooks that are in the /notebooks folder
